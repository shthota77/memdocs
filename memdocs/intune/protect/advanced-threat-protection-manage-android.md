# Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android devices you manage with Intune

When you integrate Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Defender for Endpoint), you can use device configuration profiles to modify some settings of Defender for Endpoint on Android devices.

Before proceeding, you must successfully [Configure Defender for Endpoint in Intune](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md) and onboard Android devices to Defender for Endpoint.

## Configure web protection on devices that run Android

By default, Defender for Endpoint on Android includes and enables the web protection feature. [Web protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/web-protection-overview) helps to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks.

While enabled by default, there are valid reasons to disable this protection on some Android devices. For example, you might choose to use only the Defender for Endpoint app scan feature, or to prevent web protection from using your VPN while it scans for harmful URLs.

Intune supports turning off all or part of the web protection feature. The method you use and the capabilities you can disable depend on how the Android device is enrolled with Intune:

- **Android device administrator**: Use a configuration profile to set custom OMA-URI settings on the device to disable the entire web protection feature or to disable only the use of VPNs. For general information about custom settings for Android devices, see [Custom settings](../configuration/custom-settings-android.md).

- **Android Enterprise Personally-Owned Work Profile**: Use an app configuration profile and the *configuration designer* to disable web protection. This method and enrollment type support disabling all web protection capabilities but doesn't support disabling only the use of VPNs. For general information about app configuration policies, see [Use the configuration designer](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md#use-the-configuration-designer).

- **Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile Only: **
Use an app configuration profile and the configuration designer to disable the entire web protection feature or to disable only the use of VPNs.  

To configure web protection on devices, use the following procedures to create and deploy the applicable configuration.

### Disable web protection for Android device administrator

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.

3. Enter the following settings:

   - **Platform**: Select **Android device administrator**
   - **Profile**: Select **Custom**

   Select **Create**.

4. On **Basics**, enter the following details:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name your profiles so you can easily identify them later. For example, *Android custom profile for  Defender for endpoint web protection*
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional but recommended.

5. On **Configuration settings**, select **Add**.

   Specify settings for the configuration you want to deploy:
